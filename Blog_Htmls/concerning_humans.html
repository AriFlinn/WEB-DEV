            You know like for an interview or like an application aren't you 
            supposed to write about yourself. Yet people love talking about 
            themselves during conversation. 

            Its odd since people aren't typically the type to reveal parts
            themselves lest they really want to. Society enforces cultural 
            norms to keep people in check after all, since if everyone could
            do what they wanted, that'd frankly be terrible. 

            <br>

            Yet some odd things of progression even within the past decade.
            Between 2010 and 2020s:

            <ul style="margin-left: 40px; list-style-type: circle;">
                <li> Normalization of being unhinged, Funny = Correct</li>
                <li> Weird words (brainrot): based, cringe, bussin, whatever the kids 
                    these day keep saying </li>
                <li>Idolization of extremes, just look at the politics of things</li>
                <li>Rapidly declining attention spans and rapidly decreasing common sense</li>
                <li>In ability for more individuals to commit, thus leading to more rapid and fluid relationships as well as difficulty in general decision making</li>
                <li>Rapid increase information leads to more informed, but worse decision making due to analysis paralysis</li>
                <li>Sexual revolution on everything, normalization of violence, sex, etc. Removal of many taboos of the past</li>
                <li>Pleasure based economy, dopamine is the seller of all things</li>
                <li>People are "nice" but not "kind"</li>
                <li>The death of local, physical communities, rise of digital communities (2000s-now)</li>
                <li>Absurdist humor</li>
            </ul>

            New mediums of technology enable new models of story telling
            Hence the creation of video games as a means of interactive stories. 
            They've effectively supplanted books as well as movies as the main means of 
            story telling. Movies as well are being replaced by episodic seasonally 
            based shows. 
            
            A lot of humanities energies have been shifted from not-dying to more of the 
            not-getting-bored idea of life. 
            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            <h4 class="m-4 font-bold">On Extra-verion</h4>
            Note that Extra-version and "extroversion" are different terms in both application and use <br>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            Extroversion is the personality of being outgoing, Extra-version is the personality of basically not giving a f*ck.
            These traits in my opinion and experience do not seem to correlated nor mutual; though it wouldn't be surprising if 
            Extra-version correlated with extroversion, however I've seen introverts who display levels of Extra-version. Basically 
            Extra-version can be summed up in the integration of individual's "SHADOW" with their social mask.

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            The more integrated, the more extra-verted this individual is. <br>
            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            You know that guy who can wear what they want, say what they want, do what they want, without shame; that is it. 
            The supposed authentic individuals as we call them.

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            Most people yearn to be authentic, or at least I am told. Personally, I find the mask quite safe and what is also interesting is that
            even this "authenticity" is defined differently. The unhinged is seen as authentic, and the reserved as not-authentic even 
            if these are the true personalities of a person. Perhaps it is the intuition that "loud = correct/true" which society/human nature
            is prone to believe. 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            In addition to these sentiments, there is a need to adapt to the local culture of things in order to survive. After all those individuals,
            who stand out, who could be perceived as "the other", are the individuals who can be most demonized and therefore hurt. So, is it really 
            authenticity which is praised nor good, or rather what again what we perceive as authentic which is truly praised. After all, would you 
            really view the introverted side of myself as authentic, when it is...no, because that is not the traditional adaptive culture of 
            the person which focuses on traits of extroversion, unhinged/bluntness...this is authenticity: another personality entirely.
