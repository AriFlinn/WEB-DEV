            Attention in the Age of Brainrot
            </h3>

            We don't have it, that is simple enough to see. It is rather depressing
            how within the modern state of things society has shifted towards that 
            Brave New World of instant gratification. Soma isn't a drug, it is an 
            app, how insideous; easily accessible, infinitely suppliable, to anyone 
            within the population. Yet why is that, why is everyone in this insufferable
            state of addiction. The social internet as we call it is so despicable and so 
            necessary with the development of cultures around the world. We feel 
            this compulsive urge, near constantly to just consume more and more because
            at the heart of human psychology is a desire for more yes. Yet it is killing 
            us all slowly. 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            Personally, for a good 4 years I have tried to combat the addictive spiral I often 
            find myself in. Yet, the necessity of an online presence and continuous easy access 
            to modes of dopamine. Yet, why is this? How do these systems influence us with 
            such ability. It is scary to lose control and yet that is exactly what they want isn't it. 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            The questions I wish to answer today. What is Attention? How does it work? How is it influenced
            by the world around us? How do we take back our attention? 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>


            <h3 class = "ml-4 mb-6 font-bold">
            Attention Please!
            </h3>

            So what even is attention? Attention is split between two characterisitcs: 
            intentionality and consciousness. Intentionality can be defined as a sort of mental
            state of being able to direct action. Consciousness is the awareness of that action being 
            performed. Therefore, attention is the awareness and direction of action (notice how similar this
            definition is to the idea of WORK in physics). 
            
            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            Formal definition is as stated: "the 
            state of consciousness on the process of selecting by his own psyche the information 
            he requires and on the process of choosing an algorithm for response actions, 
            which involves the intensification of sensory and intellectual activities."

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            For the sake of argument we will consider the clinical model of attention to be the 
            most accurate means of describing attention (simply because it is based in empirical 
            research). 5 components of attention are thus described:
            <li> Focused Attention: ability to respond to specific sensory stimuli</li>
            <li> Alternating Attention: ability to shift attention between tasks </li>
            <li> Divided Attention: ability to respond to multiple tasks/stimuli simultaneously</li>
            <li> Selective Attention: maintainance of attention against distractions</li>
            <li> Sustained Attention: maintainence of attention continuously</li>
            In addition, there exists two additional definitions of attention: 
            <li>Mindfulness: clinical intervention to increase attention</li>
            <li>Vigilant Attention: attention to doing "boring", mentally unstimulating things</li>

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            So that is attention summarized. Now what are distractions then? Distractions can be divided
            into two primary types: sensory and emotional. Sensory distractions is kind of like 
            opportunity costs in the sense that is price of attentiveness to one thing (when you 
            could have attention to something else). Emotional distractions are distractions which 
            cannot be ignored due to illicting an emotional response (i.e. being called a name,
            memes, etc.). Emotional distractions are probably the greatest and most common means of 
            being distracted. Perhaps there is a link between emotional regulation, focus, and 
            selective/sustained attention? 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            Now the interesting thing is to think of attention as a resource of sorts, and thus within the 
            context of a zero-sum game; this is simply because people will want your attention (and obviously
            we want attention for ourselves). There is great power in simply the ability to ignore and to 
            focus; to say no and just to do what ought to be done. Perhaps mastering this skill, the ability to 
            respectfully decline, to say "Na I'ma do my own thing", that is the best solution of them all. 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            Truly successful people will not spend their time trying to convince others of their success, 
            nor do they need to brag or educate, rather isn't it so much simpler to just show rather than tell 
            a good story? 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            Once you think of everything in the sense of projection, it'll all make more sense.
