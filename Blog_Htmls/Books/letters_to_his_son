    <!-- In general regarding book blocks  -->

    We want a more stream of conconciousness I think. 

    is it worth making friends with your parents or even among the typical individual. What is there to gain and there to lose?
    Friendship is in general a very interesting subject material
    
    "A pleasing figure is a perpetual letter of recommendaiton/ it is certainly an agreeable forerunner of merit, and asmoothes the way for it. 

    Studying 20% of modern culture will allow for 80% of the discussions I need. 

    If we think of the mask as a technology, as something which can be engineered. Then perhaps it is something which we can control in order to
    make it better. 

    Pleasing: And the art of Pleasing:
    Observe what pleases others and that will probably work...
    So what works with me:
    - Acknowledgement
    - Presence, main thing is just the time of things. 
    - Being made useful is also nice. 
    - Deeper conversations 
    - humor, to a degree
    - A level of intimacy, like lower levels of intimacy, please don't scare me too much. 
    - 3rd media enjoyment (this is like doing activities together/invitations to such things)
