            Humans are funny creatures. When we beat death in the traditional sense, 
            when we beat famine, most disease, and the horseman of the apocalypse.
            We've done nothing but come up with way of not kill ourselves through
            boredom. Yet, to beat boredom is perhaps the most fruitless thing of all 
            because we get bored and continue to keep getting bored (tolerance) and 
            that is truly terrifying. 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>


            How do we kill boredom before it kills us? Well, we haven't found that answer
            yet, but we can certainly make a business out of it. So welcome to the entertainment 
            industry.

            Are you entertained? Why are we entertained?
            </h3>
            To be frank, I'm most likely the worst person to ask what entertainment is 
            and how it works, but that is the point of this study isn't it.
            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            So lets consult wikipedia. Entertainment is primarily experience based and is associated with 
            "amusement" which itself is associated with joy and pleasure. However entertainment can serve 
            other purposes such as ceremony, religious festival, or satire. Entertainment is also 
            divided into two forms: passive audiences (plays, theatre, etc.), and active audience (games). 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            But why does it work? Psychologists say it is the attainment of gratification, yet it indeed 
            has no pragmatic benefit.  Even now, much of entertainment has been transformed into 
            "edutainment" and "infotainment"; the trifecta of media: education, marketing, 
            and entertainment. 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            In the analysis below we will look into the history of entertainment. At the end of the day 
            it is all stories, perhaps the most important skill of an individual's communication abilities is how to 
            tell stories and experiences well.  The root of almost all human entertainment therefore lies in stories 
            and from stories came differing means and mediums by which we tell such stories and language. Well at least 
            that is the past, but let us in this pursuit run with the following hypothesis: 
            
            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            "Prior to the industrial revolution the majority of innovation and inventions made by humans was made for two purposes: 
            to not die or to kill others. Post Industrial Revolution, the frivolous parts of existence came to be: both 
            technological and cultural." 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            We can therefore classify media and its extension for the sake of this post, broadcast media, as a post-industrial revolution technology
            and cultural development. We will further restrict our definition of broadcast media which defines
            media or communication for the means of entertainment; so while this technology could be used 
            for communication and broadcasting purposes its primary objective still remains that of entertainment.

                To make a long story very short:::            </h3>

            I suppose to make a long point very short. The media is designed to influence and overtake you now. Entertainment
            is meant to hold the attention of the masses and suppress everyone from truly seeing what is happening around them.
            Yet the most terrifying thing of all is how we welcome this embrace into the void of mindless "doom=scrolling" and "video rabbit holes"
            , it is all for naught, but a distraction from our own lives and the problems we simply cannot/aren't willing to deal with. 
            I would know, I have no excuse, I just feel so lonely man...like................................why.............., it's my fault isn't it.
            That is the reason for my youtube addiction, nothing more nothing less. These videos can be a very powerful tool for Learning and 
            information and yet here it is controlling me and controlling you. 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            There is no elite mind you trying to "control the world", conspiracy after all is borne through the individual's desire for causation. 
            The cause is much more simple than that, it is simply short sighted greed or rather, evolution. Industry and competition has made the
            most addictive, attention grabbing forms of media survive since that is what we consume. In a way, the reason why this consumerist, capitalist
            system of the world works so well is that it represents exactly how nature works: survival of the fittest. We reward the "fittest" companies, 
            which evolve further to become more addictive and hence we are here, lovely. 
            
            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            What is natural isn't always good after all... 

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            So, to stem the tide, to understand media we need to retake and remold it for our own needs. If I need suggestions on what to do next, I am 
            clearly doing something very wrong with my life. If I need inspiration, if I need distraction, I can find it else where, or perhaps I should 
            do without it entirely. After all, focus on one thing and you'll get it done in a day, focus on two, and you'll never finish within a year.

            <div>&nbsp;</div>
            The price of freedom is comfort.
